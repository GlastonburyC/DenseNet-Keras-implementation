# DenseNet-like architecture in Keras

An implementation of the DenseNet bottleneck architecture with growth rate = 12.

40-layer denseNet-BC like architecture. Trained on CIFAR10 without data augmentation:

```train accuracy 91%```

```validation accuracy 87%```

With (2x) dilated convolutions, validation accuracy improves to:

```train accuracy x```

```validation accuracy y```
